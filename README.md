# KillPhilosophy

An interactive web application for exploring the interconnections between philosophers, critical theorists, and other academics in the humanities.

## Overview

KillPhilosophy is a tool designed to map and visualize the relationships between various academic figures, their works, and their intellectual traditions. The application allows users to:

- Search for specific academics and explore their profiles
- Discover connections between different academics
- Browse papers, events, and intellectual traditions
- Get notifications about new content through the Novelty Tiles feature
- Perform deep searches to find relationships that aren't immediately obvious

## Features

### Academic Profiles

Detailed profiles for each academic, including:
- Biographical information
- Taxonomical classifications (discipline, tradition, era, methodology, themes)
- Papers and publications
- Key events
- Intellectual connections to other academics

### Deep Search

The Deep Search functionality allows users to:
- Find academics not yet in the database
- Discover connections between seemingly unrelated academics
- Explore intellectual lineages and influences

### Novelty Tiles

The Novelty Tiles feature surfaces new content and connections, including:
- Recently discovered lectures, papers, or interviews
- New connections between academics
- Recently added content

### Database Browser

Browse all academics in the database alphabetically, making it easy to discover new figures and explore their work.
